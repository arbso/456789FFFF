    <br>
  <li><b>Chromium:</b> Chromium is an essential trace mineral that improves
    insulin sensitivity and enhances protein, carbohydrate, and lipid
    metabolism. A small quantity of this mineral is essential for all
    individuals. Chromium may also help in losing weight. It may play a role
    in reducing depression and may help with mood regulation. Its

      medicine to treat various ailments. It may help in keeping blood sugar
